## Healthcare: Sepsis Patient Data Analysis

The project aims to analyze data related to patients suffering from Sepsis, a severe condition where the body's response to infection improperly affects several organs. The goal is to gain insights into patient distribution based on age and gender, and to analyze ICU requirements to aid in planning care for patients.

The analysis shows a higher incidence of sepsis in patients aged 54-72 and over 72. ICU data reveal critical care needs for older patients and a significant proportion of onset patients. Patients are distributed across MICU, SICU, and other ICUs, with MICU and SICU needing to handle both non-sepsis and sepsis cases. ICU length of stay (ICULOS) analysis indicates that onset patients have an average ICULOS of 59.4 days compared to 39 days for all patients, with median values of 48 and 39 days, respectively, suggesting that some onset patients with very long stays are skewing the average.

## Covid19 Data Anaylysis with PostgresSQL

This portfolio project demonstrates my expertise in data analysis using PostgreSQL by conducting a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 datasets. By creating a database, defining schemas, and utilizing advanced SQL queries and functions, I extracted key insights such as total cases and deaths, death rates, and positivity rates. Highlights include identifying Peru with the highest death rate, Slovenia with the ninth-highest, and Bosnia and Herzegovina with the third-highest. The analysis also revealed Europe as the continent with the highest deaths. This project showcases my technical skills and ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data, essential for informed decision-making.

## Navigating Financial Data with Tableau

This project leverages Tableau to analyze bank loan data, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, and payments received. By calculating month-to-date (MTD) and month-on-month (MoM) changes, it provides insights into financial trends. Good and bad loans are distinguished, with KPIs calculated for both categories. Visualizations include a donut chart for loan health, an area chart for month-wise metrics, and state-wise geographic insights. Additionally, loan distributions by term, purpose, and employee tenure are examined. The analysis aids stakeholders in making informed financial decisions and understanding borrowing habits.

## Sales Data Analysis with PostgresSQL and Visualization using Tableau

Harnessing the power of data analytics, this project delved into a Sales Dataset using Tableau, focusing on key metrics such as total sales, profit, and quantity for the year 2022. The analysis revealed significant year-on-year growth, with total sales reaching $733.2k, profit at $93.44k, and quantity at 12k units. Visualizations, including a Hex Map and Sunburst Chart, highlighted geographical sales distributions and sub-category contributions, identifying California and New York as top performers. State-wise and monthly performance analyses provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making, underscoring the effectiveness of Tableau's dynamic calculation and visualization capabilities in exploring sales dynamics.
