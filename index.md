## Healthcare: Sepsis Patient Data Analysis

The project aims to analyze data related to patients suffering from Sepsis, a severe condition where the body's response to infection improperly affects several organs. The goal is to gain insights into patient distribution based on age and gender, and to analyze ICU requirements to aid in planning care for patients.

Using Tableau, the analysis highlights several key performance indicators (KPIs) and patient demographics. The age and gender distribution revealed a higher incidence of sepsis in patients aged 54-72 and over 72. The ICU data underscores the critical care requirements for older patients and the significant proportion of onset patients. The distribution of patients across MICU, SICU, and other ICUs provides insights into the varied needs of non-sepsis, onset, and sepsis patients. Onset patients are spread across different ICUs. MICU and SICU need to be prepared to handle both non-sepsis and sepsis patients. 

The ICU length of stay analysis provides insights into resource allocation and care planning, emphasizing the need for tailored care strategies for patients with longer ICU stays. I noticed that the onset patients average ICU LOS was 59.4 as some patients had extremely long ICU stay whereas for all patients it was 39. This intrigued me to look at the median value which for all patients was 39 and for onset patients was 48. The higher average compared to the median suggests that there are some onset patients with very long ICU stays, which is pulling the average upwards.
